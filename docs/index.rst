BoxBilling documentation
========================================

This documentation is for BoxBilling: an open-source billing, client, and order management software. 
Our developers made BoxBilling easy to use for clients and sellers alike.

IMPORTANT NOTE!
-------------------------------

We wrote this documentation for release 4.22-beta.1.5 (2022-4-3) of BoxBilling.

Note: Since BoxBilling is open source and is a community-driven project.
This documentation might lag behind the current release of the software from time to time. 
If that happens, we would appreciate it if you open an issue on GitHub stating 
"the BoxBilling documentation is outdated" as the title and your observations in the body. 
And will update it at the earliest.
